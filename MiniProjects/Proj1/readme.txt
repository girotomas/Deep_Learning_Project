NOTES FOR PROJECT 1
--------------------------------
EXECUTION SPEED UNDER VIRTUAL MACHINE IS INFERIOR COMPARED TO USING A NORMAL PC. WE NOTICE THAT IF THE DEBIAN VM IS RAN WITHIN WINDOWS, PERFORMANCE IS SLOWER THAN WHEN THE VM IS RAN IN UBUNTU. 
--------------------------------
THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK ADDITIONALLY IMPORTS PANDAS FOR BETTER FORMATTING AND COMPUTATION OF ADDITIONAL SUMMARY STATISTICS OF INTEREST,
HOWEVER IT IS IN NO WAY ESSENTIAL FOR THE MODEL TO RUN. (TEST.PY DOES NOT USE PANDAS)
